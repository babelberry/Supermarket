Supermarket
=======================

## What it is?

A simple Ruby programme modelling a Supermarket till, allowing to calculate the total amount due by a client, given the items he wants to purchase. Built during week 2 of Makers Academy.

Classes used were:

- the checkout
- the item
- the line item (total per item, useful if more than 2 of one item type is purchased)


## How was it written?

- OOD - Used CRC cards to come up with the classes
